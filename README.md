# A guide to special relativity 



During my learning of special relativity, I found many ambiguous points that may be hard to comprehend. The aim of this website is to create a reference for students or physics enthusiasts  like me who want to learn special relativity by themselves. 

I am still a student, so that it is possible for me to make mistakes. Feel free to sent errors or unclear explanations as pull requests, I will correct them as soon as possible. 

Most of contents will be presented in two forms -  a PDF file or a HTML webpage for online review.
